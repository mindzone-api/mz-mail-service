# Mindzone Mail Service
Welcome to the MindZone Mail Service repository! This repo contains a simple logic that consumes the `mz-queue` from the AMQP cloud, being triggered to send a mail based on parameters. The main `mz-backend` repo project is a MVC Spring Boot mental health management platform designed to streamline the interactions between patients, psychologists, and psychiatrists. It is responsible for handling business logic, database management, authentication, and integration with third-party services such as Stripe for payments and RabbitMQ for asynchronous email notifications.

- MongoDB
- CircleCI
- OAuth2 with Google
- RabbitMQ (manages asynchronous communication for email notifications)
